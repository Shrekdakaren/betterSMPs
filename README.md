**FEATURES

** catSpawnChance When spawning a cat in a village, determine the percentage chance of it succeeding. While hanging around the base, you may often find a pesky cat appear out of nowhere. I was fed up with them spawning all the time but I also don't want to completely get rid of them, as they may be wanted for anti-phantom purposes and I didn't want to have to go to a witch hut just to get one so instead I opted to reduce the spawning instead. Spawning can still be disabled with a value of 0.

Type: integer

noPiglinGuarding Disables piglins attacking when a player interacts or breaks a block they guard. Ever just minding your own business in the nether when you thoughtlessly place down a shulker box and open it experience the wrath of piglin bystanders? Well not anymore!

returnSpectators Teleports players back to where they were when they changed to spectator. There was a scarpet script which offered this feature however the position did not persist and was forgotten when the server restarted. I decided to implement my own version which saves the survival position against the player.

sharedVillagerDiscounts Shares the major positive reputation (i.e. zombie villager cures) amongst all players. This is to stop players each having to cure villagers multiple times to access the same discounts. All other types of reputation are not shared as the curing discounts is the only target of this tweak.
